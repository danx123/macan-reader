## üìù Changelog v3.0.0

Print Preview Added: The "Print" menu (Ctrl+P) now opens the Print Preview dialog first, where you can preview how the page will print before sending it to the printer.

"Export As" Menu Added: Under the File menu, there is now an Export As submenu with two options:
Export as PNG...: Exports all PDF pages as separate image files (e.g., document_page_001.png, document_page_002.png, etc.).
Export as DOCX...: Exports all PDF pages as images embedded into a single .docx file. (Requires python-docx to be installed: pip install python-docx).
Close Thumbnail Pane Button: The thumbnail pane on the left now has a mini title bar with the heading "Thumbnails" and an 'X' button to quickly close it.

Thumbnail Context Menu: Right-clicking on any page thumbnail will now bring up a new context menu that allows you to export that specific page as:
- PDF (creates a new PDF containing only that single page)
- PNG
- DOCX (creates a new DOCX containing only an image of that single page)
Zoom Slider Icon Improved: The handles on the QSlider in the status bar now appear round in all themes, instead of flat squares.
Help Content Menu Added: Under the Help menu, there is now a Help Content option (Shortcut: F1) that opens a pop-up window with a guide on how to use the application's main features.
